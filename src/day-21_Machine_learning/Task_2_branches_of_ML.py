* Data has correct answers                           | * Data has no labels or answers.                |  * Learns using rewards and penalties.
* Used for prediction and classification.            | * Used to find hidden patterns or groups.       |  * Works by trial and error.
* Example: Spam detection, house price prediction.   | * Example: Customer segmentation, clustering.   |  * Example: Self-driving cars, game playing AI.
